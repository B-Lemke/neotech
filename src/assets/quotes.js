    "Body": "I started on a computer at 18 months. It had one of those giant mice that was just a rolling yellow ball and a single button. Sometimes I think it would be fun to get one of those and use it when I go into the office to see what others would say. ",

    "Header": "Python",
    "Body": "My first experience with python was in a group project at school. Most things were refreshers in the class, but I enjoyed making a text adventure at the end. In order to build the maps we would use a bunch of two-dimensional arrays. That’s just a fancy way of saying a grid that looks like this: ",

    "Header": "Angelator",
    "Body": "In the TV show Bones there’s a holographic display called the “Angelator”. It could display holographs and with just a few clicks could render full graphics for any situation. It doesn’t exist, but when I did an internship in college I got to work on a team that was developing Augmented Reality apps that allowed a group of people to all manipulate a 3D engine in a shared space. I can’t wait for tech like that to be used in class settings.",

    "Body": "There is a tiny computer embedded in my arm right now. It communicates to a phone that is more powerful than any PC I had growing up. That communicates to a server probably owned by Amazon or Microsoft and stores my data. That server communicates to my health care team. It’s wild that from anywhere in the world other people can see my health metrics.",

{
    "Header": "Escape Room",
    "Body": "For my partner’s birthday last year I made an escape room. I didn’t have locks or a secure area so it featured a lot of boxes with physical clues hidden around the house and a website to enter answers to the cyphers on. I spent at least 30+ hours programming it for one hour of fun.",
},
{
    "Header": "New experiences",
    "Body": "My first tech job was working with developing virtual reality. I created 360° tours of a disaster training facility at the college I worked at. It allowed people to see the facility even if they weren’t able to visit in person.",

    "Body": "When I interviewed for my current job they asked me to drive four hours and come in person for a day full of talking to people. At the end of the interviews I was asked if I wanted to see Avengers Endgame. I’d only ever seen the first one or two Avengers movies, and I hadn’t seen Infinity War. I watched the movie.",

    "Body": "Back in the day you used to be able to customize your neopets profile with CSS. It was a major factor in me learning web design. You can’t let people do that as much anymore with issues of security, but I miss when the internet was more playful.",

    "Body": "I go to a synthesizer convention every year. I love listening to people debate whether analog or software based synthesizers are better. I don’t care personally, but I love that there are hundreds of people who care and show up every tear to talk about it.",

{
    "Header": "AI in Creative Fields",
    "Body": "AI doesn’t belong in the creative field. At least not in its current form. It is trained on stolen data and it is irresponsible to use. I get so much satisfaction when I see a callout post that a company is using AI in its marketing and watching people get pissed.",

I should not have had a computer in my room in seventh grade. I fear for the generations younger than me who have unsupervised screen time because I had too much.",

    "Body": "I didn’t originally plan to work in tech. I went to school for music education but started to panic from the constant news stories of school shootings. I changed my major at the last minute to graduate early and change careers. Now I worry about vulnerabilities in key systems that could bring down a large portion of our internet infrastructure.",

The ability to know so much about what's going on in the world with a click is a power people would’ve killed for hundreds of years ago.
